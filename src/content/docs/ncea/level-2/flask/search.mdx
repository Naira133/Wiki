> writing custom queries to filter and/or sort data


Searching posts is done by using the `LIKE` command in SQL. This command allows you to search for a string within a string. The `%` character is used as a wildcard so that the search will return any post that contains the search query. Any results are then passed to the template to be displayed.

```python
@bp.route("/search")
def search():
    """Search page."""
    query = request.args.get("query")
    db = get_db()
    results = db.execute(
        (
            "SELECT id, title, body, created FROM post "
            "WHERE title LIKE ? OR body LIKE ?"
        ),
        (f"%{query}%", f"%{query}%"),
    ).fetchall()
    return render_template("blog/search.html", posts=results, query=query)
```
