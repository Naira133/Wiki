We're going to start off with a couple very basic things you can do in python.

## Printing

Printing lets you output something like a word or some numbers and even more. The `print()` function will display the given value on screen.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Comments

Comments allow you to type something out without Python thinking you're writing code. Usually you'll use comments to explain what certain methods or lines of code do. Python has 2 ways to do comments.

```python
# This is an inline comment, everything after the # on the same line will be commented out.
# Usually you'll use these to describe what a line of code is doing.

"""
This is a block comment that can go across multiple lines. It must be surrounded by 3 quotation marks on each side.
Usually you'll use these for describing what a method is doing.
"""
```

## Data Types

Python has many different ways to represent different forms of data. If you wanted to create a sentence, you would use a `str`, or string, data type. Numbers can be separated into `int`, or integer, for whole numbers, and `float` for numbers with decimals. Another data type is called a `bool` or a boolean. This type is a simple `True` or `False`. There are many more types than this, but these are a few of the basics ones.

```python
# str type
hello = "Hello, World!"

# int type
x = 10

# float type
y = 1.56

# bool type
isGreen = True
```

## Variables

Variables allow you to store values for later use. This can be helpful when you want to use the same value multiple times, and can make the code more readable.

Creating and updating variables uses the same syntax so make sure you aren't accidentally creating a new variable instead of updating a current one, or vice versa.

This is how you create and update variables:
```python
xPosition = 10.5

isFlipped = False

name = "Alice"
```

You can then use these later in the code. For example, if you wanted print the `name` variable:
```python
name = "Alice"

print(name)
```
This program will display the word `Alice`.
