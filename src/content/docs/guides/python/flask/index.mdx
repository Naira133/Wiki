## What is Flask?

Flask is a Python framework for building web applications. It is lightweight and modular, and is a great tool for building simple websites. In this guide, we will build a simple website using Flask.

## Knowledge Required

Basic familiarity with Python, HTML/CSS and SQL will be needed to build this website and resources can be found here:

- [Python](/guides/python/)
- [HTML/CSS](/guides/web/)
- [SQL](/guides/sql/)

## Getting Started

### Installing flask

To install Flask, you can use pip, which is the package manager for Python. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

### Basic Flask App

```py
// main.py
from flask import Flask

# Create a Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route
@app.route('/')
def index():
   # Return text to show on the webpage.
   return 'Hello, World!'

# Run the app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

To run the Flask app, save the code in a file called `main.py` and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start a development server on your local machine, and you can access the website by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser. You should see the text "Hello, World!" displayed on the webpage.

#### So how does this work?

<Steps>

1. Import the `Flask` class from the `flask` module.

   ```py
   from flask import Flask;
   ```

   This imports the Flask class from the Flask module, which is used to create a Flask application.

2. Create the Flask app.

   ```py
   app = Flask(__name__)
   ```

   This creates a new Flask application instance. The `__name__` argument is a special Python variable that is set to the name of the current module. This is used by Flask to determine the root path of the application.

3. Define a route.

   ```py
   @app.route('/')
   def index():
       return 'Hello, World!'
   ```

   Flask uses things called decorators to map functions to different webpages (routes). In this case, we are mapping the `index` function to the root URL `/`. When a user visits the root URL, the `index` function is called, and it returns the text "Hello, World!". For more complex applications, you can return HTML templates or JSON data.
