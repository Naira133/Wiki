Now that we have a basic understanding of how to set up a Flask application, let's create a simple website with a few pages (routes).

## Defining routes

In Flask, a route is a URL pattern that the application can respond to. When a user visits a URL, the application will execute the code associated with that URL. Routes are defined using the `@app.route` decorator.

Assuming we are building a simple website with the following pages on the `example.com` domain we can match up routes as follows:

- `@app.route("/")` - https://example.com/
- `@app.route("/about")` - https://example.com/about
- `@app.route("/contact")` - https://example.com/contact

## Creating a simple website

Let's create a simple website with the following routes:

- Home page (`/`)
- About page (`/about`)
- Contact page (`/contact`)

To add a new route we need a decorator and a function that returns the content for that route. It is best practice to name the function the same as the route.

```python
// main.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Welcome to the home page!"

@app.route("/about")
def about():
    return "This is the about page."

@app.route("/contact")
def contact():
    return "Contact us at:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

## Returning HTML content

While we have just been returning simple strings in our routes, we can also return HTML content. This allows us to create more complex web pages with styling and formatting.

Let's update our routes to return HTML content:

```diff lang="python"
// main.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
-    return "Welcome to the home page!"
+    return "<h1>Welcome to the home page!</h1>"

@app.route("/about")
def about():
-    return "This is the about page."
+    return "<h1>About us</h1><p>This is the about page.</p>"

@app.route("/contact")
def contact():
-    return "Contact us at:
+    return "<h1>Contact us</h1><p>Contact us at:</p>"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Now when you visit the home page, about page, or contact page, you will see the HTML content returned by the routes.

- Home page (`/`) - `<h1>Welcome to the home page!</h1>`
- About page (`/about`) - `<h1>About us</h1><p>This is the about page.</p>`
- Contact page (`/contact`) - `<h1>Contact us</h1><p>Contact us at:</p>`
